    • Free images in original, small, medium and large sizes → https://unsplash.com
    • Set descriptive names for images; helps search engine optimization
    • <img>
      - Attributes:
        • src="" → relative/absolute path of the image
        • alt="" → provide an alternative textual description of the image
                 → use for blind people who use text-speech
                 → helps search engine to understand context
                 → when the image is not loaded(net issue) we see alternative text

    -- CSS
    • width: Used to define width of the content
    • height: Used to define height of the content
    • object-fit: cover; → Image cover its CONTAINING box(not the margin, border, padding; only the content!)
                         → so the image will resize
                         → potentially crop to display in the entire box
