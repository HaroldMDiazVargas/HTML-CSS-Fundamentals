     • <div> → division element; by default not visual appear!
             → Block-level Element: Start on a new line and fit at the all available space(all width)!
       • We can add inside this what we want e.g Hero block(backgroud, header and a paragraph)
       
     • <span> → container often used for styling text, icon, logos, so on
              → Inline-level Element: Not start on a new line and not going to fit at the all width of the page

    Semantic container:
     - Use this wherever is possible; helps search engine to better understand our pages!
     - These are more meaningul
     • <article> → Represent articles; any independent self-container content:

                   → images, tables, list, so on!
     • <figure> → We use this to wrap <img> to set this is a figure and not just an image!
                → Just a container for figures; like figures have caption we use:
                  • <figcaption> Caption </figcaption> → We can set the text caption 
     • <mark> → We can use this when we can to replace <span> container when we are using as styling any text!
