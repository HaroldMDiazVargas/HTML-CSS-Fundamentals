    - Selector specifity (weigth) or specifity triangle:
      - ID selector => very specific (1,0,0) 
      - Class & attribute selector => (0,1,0) 
      - Element selector => less specific; (0,0,1) 

    - Base on this weigth, browser decided what selector of css apply to style the elements!
    - These can be combine such as:
      - Apply element selector with pseudo-class => (0,1,1)
      - Apply element selector with pseudo-element => (0,0,2)
      - ...

    - Don't use !important keyword to discard other rules!!
        e.g selector {
            ...  !important;   BAD PRACTICE!
        }
