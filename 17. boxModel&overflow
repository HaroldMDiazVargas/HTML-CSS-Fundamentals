    - Set size of elements:
    • width: By default are applied only to the content box
    • height: By default are applied only to the content box
    • padding: ... → By default makes looks our element with more size 
    • border: ... → By default makes looks our element with more size

    • box-sizing: content-box → the width and heigth(size) are applied only to the content box (default value)
    • box-sizing: border-box → the width and height(size) are applied to border+padding+content 

    *, *::before, *::after{
        box-sizing: border-box;             BEST PRACTICE!
    }           
    

    - Overflowing:
    • overflow: visible; → we see the overflow content (default value) in both x & y directions
    • overflow: hidden; → we hidden the overflow content in both x & y directions
    • overflow: scroll; → we see scroll bars(even if there's not content) to see overflow content in x & y directions
    • overflow: auto; → we see scroll bars(only if there's overflow) to see overflow content in x & y directions
    • overflow: hidden auto; → we see 'y' scroll bar(only if there's overflow) and we hide overflow content in x direction!
    • overflow-x: hidden/auto/visible;
    • overflow-y: hidden/auto/visible;
