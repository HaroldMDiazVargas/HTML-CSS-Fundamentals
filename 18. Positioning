    - Set position:
    • position: static → appear exactly at the normal position (default value for all elements!)

    • position: relative → allow position element relative to its normal position without affect sibling elements position
      • left: ±value;    → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis)
      • top: ±value;     → Add space at vertical level   (move at y axis)
      • right: ±value;   → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis)
      • bottom: ±value;  → Add space at vertical level   (move at y axis)
      • z-index: ±value; → move at z axis (closer or away from us); this rule takes value without units!

    • position: absolute → allow position element relative to its container affecting sibling elements(render as if doesn't exist)
                         → to make this works, the container itsel must allow position relative (position: relative)
      • left: ±value;    → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis) starting at left side of the container
      • top: ±value;     → Add space at vertical level (move at y axis) starting at top side of the container
      • right: ±value;   → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis) starting at right side of the container
      • bottom: ±value;  → Add space at vertical level (move at y axis) starting at bottom side of the container
       
    • position: fixed  → position fixed element relative to the viewport  affecting sibling elements(render as if doesn't exist)
      • left: ±value;    → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis) starting at left side of the viewport
      • top: ±value;     → Add space at vertical level (move at y axis) starting at top side of the viewport
      • right: ±value;   → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis) starting at right side of the viewport
      • bottom: ±value;  → Add space at vertical level (move at y axis) starting at bottom side of the viewport    

    • position: sticky → position relative based on the user's scroll position.
                       → the element start at normal position
                       → the element position relative to its normal position when the scroll is pass!
                       → the element only position when scroll pass over the container, the element does't goes far away of its container!
      • left: ±value;    → Add space at horizontal level (move at x axis) when scroll pass horizontal
      • top: ±value;     → Add space at vertical level (move at y axis) when scroll pass vertical
