Helper classes vs BEM:
    Definition:
      - We can choose between helpers classes approaches or use just BEM approach for our styles
    
    Helper classes:
      - These are classes like globally that represent some styles we can use in different parts of our page
        so we can re use that class and it has a meaningful name 
        e.g class="green" => this is a class that represents a green background!
    
    BEM:
      - When we want to add modifications of color, style(skin) of our elements, we use the modifier convention:
        e.g class="block--green" => this represent a green bakcground for a given block!
    
    Using both:
      - Is not a bad approach if we use both conventions, so we can use BEM and if we find we can reuse helper classes
        for various blocks, it would be nice, making even our classes names more meaningful and global
    
    So in conclusion we can put in our globals/ partials these Helper Classes!!
