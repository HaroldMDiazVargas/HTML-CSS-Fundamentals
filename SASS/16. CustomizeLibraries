Extend libraries
    Definition:
      - If we want to use our own library or another one library and if we maybe want to change some styles about:
        - theme(primary, secondary, so on)
      - Define our own global rules that will change look!
    
    !default word:
      - We need to apply this in all the variables(in the library) we want to customize by the user 
      - This means, the variable will take the value ONLY IF there's not a default value pre setted!
      e.g $color-primary: red !default;

    Order of @forward!
      - So we need to import the libraruy AFTER we set the our customize properties!

  
-- e.g

$color-primary: blue;

@forward "library"
